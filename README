NAME
    MooseX::Types::LogAny - Moose Types for Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
            use Moose;
            use Class::Load 0.20 'load_class';
            use MooseX::Types::LogAny qw( LogAny );

            has log => (
                    isa     => LogAny,
                    is      => 'ro',
                    lazy    => 1,
                    default => sub { load_class('Log::Any')->get_logger },
            );

DESCRIPTION
    The motivation behind this modules is that Log::Any::Adapter::Null does
    not inherit from Log::Any::Adapter::Base which all of the other adapters
    do. Moose will not allow a type union of undefined types unless they are
    Moose classes. This module allows you to simply use the LogAny type
    which has done the union for you.

SUBROUTINES
